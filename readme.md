Dear Marker,

Included in this submission was a request for a short summary of the challenges
that I found I faced during creation of the checkpoint assessment.

This process was a huge overload of all the culminating assessment checkpoints beforehand
I found that working with CSS was a process of play and research and experimentation.
I found it grueling against the clock of "progress" - which I appreciate being there, but it I feel like it squanders my ability in being able to play or add more to the project,
based on the time constraint. (which is inevitable in 'real'world/results driven expectations.)

My biggest challenge with the code was learning how to manipulate it to do what I wanted. I did feel like there would be other ways to go about creating the result using a far more succinct syntax, but it's all part of the process.

It was a challenge on wether I wanted to create a table <tb> or in which way I would manipulate an unordered list. Attacking the challenge from the mindset of rows or columns. While loving Zach Lebars 'code it up' sessions - I've been learning a lot regarding columns and tried to implement some of that into my results.

The original challenge I faced was aligning the <h1> tag with the chervon image. Initally I was pulling the image from fontawesome.com but it wasn't aligning with the H1 tag, so I thought about hosting it from my own image file which posed the same result. I went ahead and used my own image in my image folder as I had already kept my map image in the same space and the "alert" icon, that I am hesitant to use but am about to play with.

I also am finding it hard to justify the base of the box-model. I got my code to scroll my bus listings but the longer I make the website that the code it staged on, the longer the box gets... So I have to figure that out.

I am submitting this work, which after sending through to the team, while I am working on to add a few more things, in hope to learn more as I go. This was challenging.
